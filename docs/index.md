# Getting started

## Authentication

1.  Find and copy a *Project API Token*. You can find the token within a repository *Settings* → *Integrations* → *Project API*.

    !!! warning
        You should keep your API token well protected, as it grants owner permissions to your projects.

1.  Set the *Project API Token* in your terminal, replacing `%Project_Token%` with your token:

    ```bash
    export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=%Project_Token%
    ```

    To upload coverage to a self-hosted installation of Codacy you also need to set your installation URL, replacing `%Codacy_instance_URL%` with your URL:

    ```bash
    export CODACY_API_BASE_URL=%Codacy_instance_URL%:16006
    ```

!!! hint
    If you'd like to automate this process for multiple repositories you can [authenticate using an Account API Token](advanced/authenticating-using-account-token.md).


## Running Codacy Coverage Reporter

The easiest way to get starting is by using the self-contained script that downloads and runs the reporter:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh)
```

### Caching the binary

The self-contained script is able to cache the binary. To avoid having to download it everytime,
you need to add one of the following directories to your CI cached folders:

- `$HOME/.cache/codacy` on Linux
- `$HOME/Library/Caches/Codacy` on Mac OS X

### Choose a specific version

The script uses by default the latest version.

If you want to specify a coverage reporter version, use `CODACY_REPORTER_VERSION` environment variable.

You can find all versions in the [Releases tab](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/releases).

### Manual Installation

Using CircleCI? Check out the [codacy/coverage-reporter orb](advanced/installation-methods.md#circleci-orb).

Using GitHub Actions? Check out the [codacy/coverage-coverage-reporter action](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter-action#codacy-coverage-reporter-action).

If the automated script does not cover your use case, [check the manual installation methods](advanced/installation-methods.md#manually-downloading-the-native-binary).

## Supported formats

The following table contains the formats supported and which coverage tools generate them:

The reporter assumes the coverage reports filename follow the name convention. Otherwise, you must define the report's location with the flag `-r`.

!!! note
    If your coverage reports are in a different format you can use a format converter, such as [ReportGenerator](https://danielpalme.github.io/ReportGenerator/), to generate a supported format.

### Unsuported Languages

If your language is not in the list of supported languages, you can still send coverage to Codacy. You can do it by providing the correct `--language` name and then add the `--force-language` flag.

## Commit SHA hash detection

Codacy automatically detects a commit SHA hash from CI workflows, the git repository or command line arguments. See [all supported environments](troubleshooting/commit-detection.md).

## Multiple coverage reports for the same language

You can upload multiple reports if your test suite is split in different modules or ran in parallel. See [how to upload multiple coverage reports](advanced/multiple-reports.md).

## Other commands
